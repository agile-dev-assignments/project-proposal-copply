## What and why?
Copply is a web application used to address the inefficiencies in job applications. Traditionally, an applicant would go to a company’s website to apply for a job. Once they arrive at the job application, they would have to upload their resume, then fill out all of the basic information found on their resume all over again (due to faulty resume scanners). This is a problem for multiple reasons. One, it annoys the applicants who have to fill out the same information over and over again: an applicant can easily apply to at least 100 companies and each time they apply, they most likely will have to fill out the same basic information. Two, it detracts the applicant from devoting their time to answering the company specific questions an application would have (like why do you want to work here?), possibly making their answers weaker and making them less attractive to companies who want to hire high quality individuals.

## For whom?
This application is meant to benefit both applicants and companies. Applicants have an easier time applying to jobs and waste less time. Companies can create job applications easily through Copply and applicants would be more inclined to fill out the application because of the autocompletion features and ease of use.

## How?
Applicants would create a Copply account and fill out all of the basic information applications typically have (like experience or education history). On the business side, a company would create a Copply business account, which then allows them to create a job application form that contains all of the basic information fields and their own custom questions. This job application form would now be available at a URL like copply.io/amazon/marketing. If an applicant arrives at this URL, and they have a Copply account, all of their basic information will be filled out automatically, and once they submit their application the company will see the new application in their dashboard.

When both applicants and companies use Copply, they are essentially working together to create a more seamless application process. The essence of this gives Copply the basis of its name: Cooperative Application

## Scope
We believe that it would be feasible to complete an MVP during the duration of this semester. An MVP would include applicant and company accounts, a simple interface for companies to create a job application form, and autocomplete for when applicants arrive at a job application’s URL. If time permits, we would like to include many more additional features, such as a flushed out company dashboard displaying statistics and all of the applicants who applied, a flushed out applicant dashboard where they can keep track of the companies they applied to, a more advanced user interface for creating job applications, etc.
